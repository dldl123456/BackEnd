</h3>
<h1>Read Me</h1>
<p align="center">CubeTwister is your 
  companion to your Rubik's Cube. CubeTwister is a highly configurable editor for 
  cube scripts (aka maneuvers). <br />
</p>
<h2>Feature Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Accurate 
      3D models</b> of the followig cubes: Rubik's Cube, 
      Rubik's Barrel, Rubik's Diamond, Rubik's Cuboctahedron, Pocket Cube, Revenge Cube and Professor Cube.<br />
      All models can have individual color schemes. 
      The models can even be disassembled. The models are organized per document, multiple 
      cubes per document are supported.<br />
      You can edit the models to reflect your 
      collection of cubes.<br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <b>configurable parser</b> for all cube notations there are.<br />
      Supports quarter-turn 
      twists, half-turn-twists, rotations, permutations, inversions, reflections, repetitions, 
      conjugations, commutations, and macros.<br />
      The notations are organized per document, 
      multiple notations per document are supported.<br />
      You can define your own 
      notation, and you can translate between notations.<br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>A <b>database</b> for scripts, maneuvers and pretty patterns.<br />
    Cubes, Notations, 
    Scripts and Texts are organized in a tree structure.<br />
    The documents are saved 
    in XML format and can be edited using other XML tools.<br />
    You can enter all 
    your scripts and supportive documentation in CubeTwister <br /></p>
  </li>
  <li><p>A sophisticated <b>solver</b> for optimizing your scripts.<br />
    Features a Kociemba Two-Phase Solver (derived 
    from Greg Schmidt's KCube program). The solver generates scripts which are only 
    two or three twists longer than the optimal solution.<br />
    You can enter an arbitrary state of the cube und let it solve. And  you
    can
    optimise
    
    your scripts using the solver.</p></li>
  <li>A collection of interactive <b>applets</b> for inclusion in your web site.<br />
    You can integrate virtual cubes and script player applets in your web site. CubeTwister can generate the HTML pages for you, or you can create the HTML code by yourself.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
